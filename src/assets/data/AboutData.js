        text1: "Embarking on this quest, we set out to touch the lives of approximately 150 special children each year. Our journey took us from one local government to another, primarily in the South-South region. The children we met along the way were nothing short of extraordinary – each one gifted with a unique spirit that warmed our souls.\n\nAs the days turned into years, our humble school grew and flourished, fueled by the unwavering support of our compassionate community. And then, in 2019, a momentous turning point arrived when the benevolent government of Mr. Godwin Obaseki extended their helping hand. Their assistance was a testament that our collective dream was worth nurturing.",
        text2: "But the pinnacle of our journey so far was on that unforgettable day – April 1st, 2021. The anticipation and excitement filled the air, our hearts swelled with pride as His Excellency; Mr. Godwin Obaseki inaugurated the first phase of our permanent site. A moment etched in eternity, he pledged to go beyond, promising to build a modern hostel where our cherished children could find comfort and solace. The land he acquired for a playground was a gesture of love, where the laughter of these little souls would resonate for generations to come.\nWith each passing day, our bond with these remarkable children grows stronger, reminding us that we are not just building structures but nurturing dreams and touching hearts."
